**Approach and Hypotheses:**

I aimed to consolidate data by clinician_id to integrate all clinician details with each unique visit conducted. Initially, I utilized R for data wrangling, focusing on metrics such as patient return rates after their first visit and provider switching. These metrics were then transferred into Tableau for visualization.

My main hypothesis was to investigate quarterly retention rates by license type, aiming to identify any significant variations over time. I intended to delve deeper by stratifying retention rates by licensing level and further categorizing by employment type. This approach would facilitate a nuanced visual depiction of high and low performers within the organization.

**Measurement of Patient Retention:**

Patient retention was defined as their return to Included Health within a three-year timeframe. For the purpose of this case study, any returning patient was considered retained. In real-world scenarios, I would collaborate with clinical and operational stakeholders to establish a specific timeframe that defines retention.

**Conclusions on Therapist Retention:**

Overall, the analysis revealed no standout trends in retention rates across general groupings of therapists. Outliers were predominantly observed at the individual clinician level, warranting further investigation. Notably, towards the end of 2022, licensed full-time counselors exhibited a non-retention rate of approximately 11-12%, notably higher than their counterparts in the ~5% range. Similarly, by Q4 2023, clinical social workers stood out with a 12% non-retention rate.

**Influence of License and Employment Type on Retention:**

The analysis suggested that license and employment type may influence retention rates. However, no conclusive patterns emerged at the general grouping level, indicating that any influence is likely more pronounced at the individual clinician level.

**Recommendations for Practice Actions:**

Based on the findings, I recommend focusing on investigating individual outliers in retention rates. It would be beneficial to engage stakeholders to determine if recent operational changes could have contributed to heightened non-retention rates. For instance, instances where therapist turnover led to lapses in patient follow-up should be thoroughly reviewed.
